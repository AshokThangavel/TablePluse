**TablePluse** is an integrated application designed to help developers and teams **visualize and understand SQL database tables** with clarity. It provides tools to explore table structures, analyze relationships, and gain insights into your data schema — laying the groundwork for future enhancements like UI screen mapping and app design integration.
